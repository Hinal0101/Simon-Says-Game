# Simon-Says-Game
This Game is built to have a grip on JavaScript Concepts.

## Game Funda:
1. Press any key on keyboard to start the game.
2. We will see any of the button(divs) flashing.
3. Remember the flashed button(div) and press the same button.
4. If you have correctly clicked the div then it will take you to next level.
5. Or the game will be over and will print the score. For restarting you can again press any key on keyboard.
6. If it goes to next level it will randomly again flash the div
7. Here, we should have remembered the all the previous levels flashed divs and new one too.
8. Click all of them from start till new one and that will take us to next level.
9. This continues.. till we make correct clicks and score increases.

## Using the game funda we need to think of logic and build game.
